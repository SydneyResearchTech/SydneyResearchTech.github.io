## Summary

GitOps is an infrastructure operational framework that utilises the advantages of version control, collaboration, compliance, and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD).

The University of Sydney, Research Technology group utilises GitOps practices to effectively manage multiple Kubernetes cluster deployments. This technique provides a number of advantages including but not limited to:
* Greatly reduces the total cost of ownership
* Segregates out subject mater experts and business practices
* Provides reproducible outcomes
* Enhances collaboration and visibility

Research Technology group has taken the initiative to prioritise a Hybrid-Cloud model for research infrastructure deployment and long term support. A Hybrid-cloud allows for a support model that provides:
* Rapid development and migration to production ready services
* The ability to provide services within a context and/or location that aligns to the best outcome for the project
* Removes many restrictions imposed by more traditional technology approaches
